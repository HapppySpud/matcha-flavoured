# Yes, the milking reserve can go negative
#       Why?: If a player tries to milk a cow at 3 and it hurt the cow, the milk bucket would not be used, so a player would think that they are at 0
#             If the cow did not get hurt, the player would be confused as to why they couldn't milk, and assume there is no more milk left, even if there was at least 3 bottles worth
#             So overmilking seemed like a fine solution, it would still need the time to gain the milk back, the debt must still be paid
